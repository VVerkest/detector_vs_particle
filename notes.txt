pythia6 with pt-dependent efficiencey vs. pythia6+Geant
  pt(particle)<=====>pt(detector)



  HISTOGRAMS:
~ number of jets (difference)
~ number of constituents per jet (difference)
~ jet pt differences
~ constituent pt differences


" Yeah so on a jet by jet basis we can say "a jet with x pt was probably really a jet with y pt"
  But we can't say "the missing pt was, with high probability, in 3 missing particles with pt a,b,c"
  Which is what you'd need to do to correct geant to Pythia "
